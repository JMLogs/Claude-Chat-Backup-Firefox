## FAQ

### Who can access my data?
Your conversations stay between you, your device and Anthropic. Maybe some [insert intelligence agency] agent too, but they don't count.

### Are you planning to add more features?
Nope. This extension does one thing, and it does it well.

### Will you be updating this regularly?
Unless it breaks, probably not. It works, so why mess with it?

### Can you add support for [insert any feature]?
See previous answers. The extension backs up conversations. That's it.

### I found a bug. Will you fix it?
If it's stopping the extension from doing its one job, maybe. Otherwise, see above.

### Can I contribute to this project?
You're welcome to fork it and go wild. Or shamelessly copy-paste it, I don't care. I won't do any PR reviews though, so I guess no.

### Will you port this to Chrome/Safari/Opera/etc.?
That sounds like work. So, no.

### How often should I back up my conversations?
Whenever you feel like it.

### Is there a premium version with more features?
There isn't even a basic version with more features.

### Where can I get support?
You're looking at all the support you're going to get. This FAQ is it.

### Are you okay?
No, I hate front-end development. Claude did >90% of the work and I still hated it.
